Copy all the files into
~/iot-lab/parts/contiki/examples/iotlab/04-er-rest-example

Compile

Note!!
1. This file has a combined coap-server / coap-client. It is for automation and data exchange between a COAP server and a COAP client on a sensor node..
2. If you overwrite the file, you will lose the old coap-client, which may affect your other projects. Therefore, ALWAYS make a backup of your old file. 
3. To avoid overwriting your old files, I recommend that you create another backup environment of iot-lab, and install these files there. So you will have two environments and they will not collide with each other.
4. When you use it for your environment, REMEMBER to update the IP address according to your settings!
